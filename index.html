                To all our front-line fighters -doctors, nurses, police, CISF, news reporters, cleaners - keeping us safe!!!</strong></h2>
            <h3>While many of us have the privilege to “coronavirus and chill,” aka stay home and safe amid the coronavirus outbreak, we should all be grateful to those doing vital work that leaves them exposed. It’s not just everyone working in health care,
                though they’re certainly the front line, but a bevy of others keeping our society functioning. It’s the doormen and delivery guys, the Uber and taxi drivers, the cops and the MTA workers, grocery and pharmacy staff. With the rest of us
                tucked into our homes, these folks are taking the risk daily to keep our fridges and pantries stocked, ensure that those who need medications have them — and that travel remains possible, the lights stay on, etc. In fact, these sorts of
                services are in such high demand, Amazon announced it’s hiring another 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers as online demand increases. Not all heroes wear capes — some ride bikes with food strapped to their backs during an infectious-disease
                outbreak. Thank you to all who are showing up, despite the risks and fears. We quite literally couldn’t keep going without you.</h3><br><br> OUR FRONTLINE WARRIORS WORK VERY HARD TO SERVE OUR NATION.<br> HELPING THEM IS OUR DUTY!!!<br>

                <p><span style="font-size:36px"><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly changed the way people approach their healthcare.The global healthcare system has lagged in its ability to effectively respond to novel and highly contagious viruses. However, we are learning and updating protocols
                    for diagnosing, treating, containing, and curing these types of global pandemics. Furthermore, frontline healthcare workers are expanding their roles and assuming greater responsibilities while fighting this viral epidemic.<br> Here are a
                    few of the critical roles that have been proposed and implemented.<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Role of Nurses During a Pandemic.</li>
                        <li>The Role of Medical Assistants During a Pandemic.</li>
                        <li>The Role of Medical Office Administrators During a Pandemic.</li>
                    </ul></p></span>
                    <p id="b1" style="display:none">
                        The Role of Nurses During a Pandemic<br> A nurse’s role in a pandemic is dramatically expanded and increasingly critical. Nurses become the most important player in the screening, early diagnosis, and ongoing monitoring of infected
                        patients. Nurses also assume the vital role of documenting a patient’s status and communicating it to other health officials. Patients require nebulized medications and intubation, both of which increase the risk of airborne infection
                        to the nurse. Because infection increases the patient’s risk of developing wounds, nurses must increase their vigilance for wound prevention.<br>
                        <br> The Role of Medical Assistants During a Pandemic<br> In a pandemic crisis, Medical Assistants (MAs) may be needed to provide greater assistance and increase their clinical responsibilities as doctors and nurses become overloaded.
                        As the number of patients surge, MAs may need to perform more of the first stage procedures, including patient education, triage, and patient prep. Medical Assistants may also be utilized for care services, such as remote physiologic
                        monitoring (RPM) under the supervision of the physician or other qualified healthcare professionals.
                        <br>
                        <br> The Role of Medical Office Administrators During a Pandemic<br> Perhaps the most valuable role of Medical Office Administrators (MOAs) during a pandemic is communication. In addition to canceling and postponing non-critical
                        appointments and procedures, MOAs are relied upon to communicate the status of patients who have tested positive to the appropriate officials. Once they have done so, steps can be taken to track and contain the virus. MOAs can
                        also help secure adequate medical supplies (PPEs in particular) during an outbreak. These supplies may include masks, gloves, eye protection, sanitizers, isolation gowns, testing kits, medications, and other life-saving equipment.
                        <br> we thank our doctors and the medical staff team to be so dedicated towards their duty and risking their as well as their family life to serve the nation.

                    <p style="font-size:24px">The CISF provides security cover to 300 industrial units, government infrastructure projects and facilities and establishments located all over India. Industrial sectors like atomic power plants, space installations, mines, oil fields
                        and refineries, major ports, heavy engineering, steel plants, barrages, fertiliser units, airports and hydroelectric/thermal power plants owned and controlled by Central Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs), and currency note presses
                        producing Indian currency are protected by CISF. It thereby covers installations all over India straddling a variety of terrain and climatic conditions. CISF also provides consultancy services to private industries as well as other
                        organisations within the Indian government. The scope of practice includes security consulting and fire protection consulting. CISF is a unique organisation in the paramilitary forces of India, which works for seaways, airways
                        and some of the major installations in India. In the CISF there are some reserved battalions which works with the state police to preserve law and orders. The CISF plays a major role in Disaster Management. The CISF has a 'Fire
                        Wing' which helps during fire accidents in Industries where the CISF is on guard.

                            CISF plays a vital role in every feilds.<br> 1)CISF protection to Non-Nationalised Industry/ Corporate sector<br> The Indian Parliament on 25 February 2009 authorised the provision of Central Industrial Security Force security
                            to private and cooperative establishments across the country for a fee with the passage of the CISF (Amendment) Bill, 2008. The Bill, which was passed by Rajya Sabha on 19 February and Lok Sabha on 25 February 2009, also provides
                            for deployment of CISF to protect Indian missions abroad and its participation in the UN peacekeeping operations.<br> 2)Universities Security<br> Vice-Chancellor of Visva-Bharati University in Santiniketan has asked the Central
                            Government to permanently deploy Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel on its campus.<br> 3)Airport security<br> The CISF is in charge of airport security at all commercial airports in India. Airport security,
                            in the past, was under the control of airport police (under the relevant state government). However, following the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 in 1999, the topic of handing over security of the airports to the CISF
                            was first proposed. While this proposal lay low for the next two years, the central government decided to respond to the security threat faced by all major nations.<br>4)Security for Delhi Metro<br> Security on the Delhi Metro
                            is handled by the CISF Unit Delhi Metro Rail Corporation of CISF, who have been guarding the system ever since they took over from the Delhi Police in 2007.[12] Closed-circuit cameras are used to monitor trains and stations,
                            and feed from these is monitored by both the CISF and Delhi Metro authorities at their respective control rooms.<br> 5)Fire Wing<br> Besides providing protection, safety, and security to Industrial undertaking/installations,
                            CISF also offers protection against Fire hazards. CISF has a highly specialised, trained and fully equipped fire wing. The first fire wing unit with a strength of 53 personnel was Inducted in FACT Cochin. As on date, the fire
                            wing has been inducted in 91 units. The present strength of the Fire Wing is 6769 personnel.

                    <COVID-19, style="font-size:24px">COVID-19, also known as coronavirus, has become an epidemic disruption, impacting customer service and support delivery and affecting customers worldwide. Customer service and support leaders should use this appraisal to establish
                        near- and long-term strategies for responding to potential impacts.While customer service and support leaders are familiar with business continuity and disaster recovery planning, pandemic planning is different because of its wider
                        scope and the uncertainty of impact. The global and dynamic impact of events such as COVID-19 also require planning for longer recovery times and many scenarios; because pandemic events are so fluid, things can change quickly and
                        without notice. Customer service and support leaders need well-developed but flexible plans to deal with COVID-19. These plans should address operational continuity, staff morale and customer demand.

                            Customer service and support leaders preparing business continuity plans focused on widespread infectious threats such as COVID-19 should: Maintain continuity of business operations by completing a workforce planning assessment and determining your outsourcing
                            and work-from-home options. Keep quarantined employees engaged and productive by providing them with the opportunity to perform offline work and participate in online training. Proactively notify customers of any status or

Participants represented a wide variety of organizations including hospitals, universities and research institutes, professional bodies and academic societies, United Nations agencies and other international organizations, national government departments and agencies, non-governmental organizations, labour unions, and the private sector. As the numbers of daily deaths as a result of the ongoing Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic begin to decline and conversations intensify around lifting restrictions on both individuals and businesses in a number of countries, this webinar sought to address the growing demand for information on how this can be achieved safely, and implications of the pandemic’s secondary impacts for business and society going forward. The webinar’s speakers were able to highlight specific challenges faced across a range of sectors.</p></span>

                        The current COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented, but the global response draws on the lessons learned from other disease outbreaks over the past several decades. As part of WHO’s response, the R&D Blueprint was activated to accelerate diagnostics, vaccines
                        and therapeutics for this novel coronavirus. The Blueprint aims to improve coordination between scientists and global health professionals, accelerate the research and development process, and develop new norms and standards to
                        learn from and improve upon the global response. On 30 January 2020, following the recommendations of the Emergency Committee, the WHO Director-General declared that the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International
                        Concern (PHEIC). World scientists on COVID-19 then met at the World Health Organization’s Geneva headquarters on 11–12 February 2020 to assess the current level of knowledge about the new virus, agree on critical research questions
                        that need to be answered urgently, and to find ways to work together to accelerate and fund priority research to curtail this outbreak and prepare for those in the future.

                    timetabled parcel services to strengthen government's efforts in managing the challenges and adverse impact of the coronavirus outbreak in the country. At almost 400 tonnes, the Northern Railway ferried the maximum items followed by
                    Western Railway (328.84 tonnes) and Central Railway (136 tonnes). While the railways has played a significant role in transporting essential commodities across the country, it has also been helping people with medical aid when necessary.

                    They are paying bonuses to front-line employees still working, or offering extra paid time off for those who are sick or self-quarantined, financial assistance with child care, or virtual doctors’ appointments. In a global pandemic, the added benefits aren’t just the right thing to do for employees, they’re also a valuable public health measure that could help slow the disease’s spread, bankers say.
                    
                    The $473 billion-asset Truist in Charlotte, N.C., for example, said that it would increase paid time off and family care benefits and pay a special childcare allowance to employees making less than $50,000 per year. And JPMorgan Chase said Friday that it will pay $1,000 bonuses to branch employees who make less than $60,000 and continue to work on-site.
                    <p id="b45" style="display:none">
                        Keeping employees and customers as safe as possible is every bank's top priority, which is why banks are embracing telework and social distancing, providing paid sick leave, expanding safe banking services through drive-up windows, and personalized 'golden hours' appointments for at-risk seniors,” Paul Benda, the enior vice president, risk and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association said in an email. “These efforts are just one way America's banks are trying to stop the spread of COVID-19, while still supporting the economy."

The additional benefits are just one way the banking industry has responded to the impacts of the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. Over the past two weeks, banks have also reduced and eliminated travel, sent many employees home to work remotely, and closed or limited access to branches.

The virus first emerged in the U.S. in late January, but spread fast in March and soon reached pandemic status. The U.S. had 10,442 cases of coronavirus, including 150 deaths, as of Friday morning, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
